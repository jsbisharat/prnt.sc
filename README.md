Print Screen

Visit the URL, https://prnt.sc/, while appending a mix of 6 characters ( a - z, 0 - 9 ) to the end of the URL for a random screenshot somebody decided to paste on the site.

You find some funny screenshots.

You find some weird ones.

You find some boring ones.

Refresh the page to generate a random URL. The URL is placed in a text file to avoid having duplicate generated strings. The image is saved into a folder named after the website hosting the particular image. You can adjust the script accordingly for any new image hosting websites.

Have fun!
